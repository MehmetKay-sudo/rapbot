Hello Coders!

I wanted to create a bot in python to train rapping. Acutally this bot will battlerap against you, depending on the words
you give the bot. 

I just started the project for educational purposes, in order to show pupils how to create lists and loops.
This repo is unoffical. 

This is the official repo of rapbot. 
I need someone who understands API programming (OpenAI). 
If you are interested to participate, write to mehmetkay-sudo@proton.me or create a thread here in Github. 

Thanks!
