Hello Coders!

Imagine a world, where everybody could compete with a machine, to become the best rapper on earth! Imagine where kids can train rapping with a bot and figure out rhymes, punchlines and battle schemes with crazy metaphors. 
This is the mission of rapbot. 

Here is just a basic program, which was debugged in gpt4all with a language model. I wrote the basic program. 

My wish is to establish a program, which animates children in schools to start rapping and engage with language in a creative way. 

This is the official repo of rapbot. 
I need someone who understands API programming (OpenAI). 
If you are interested to participate, write to mehmetkay-sudo@proton.me or create a thread here in Github. 

Thanks!
