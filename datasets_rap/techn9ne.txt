Pistol packin' and money mackin'
Rappin' about the city where killaz keep it crackin'
Too dark and gritty, back in the dizzy
Jackin' was happenin'
Gafflin' many cacklin'
Now we packagin' crack and the addicts will POP
Kansas City, Missouri
Feel the fury of the inner city
Poverty stricken, novelty spittin'
Follow me quick into the bottom
We gotta be thizzlin'
No frickin apology given
You trippin', we lick a SHOT
Get ready to brawl, hometown
Breakin' a jawbone clown
You ain't a criminal killa
Be ready to get up and fall on down
Look at the darkside
Fulla the gangbangin'
Hookers wit' choppas
And the coppaz they keep them thangs rangin'
You ain't gotta be killa gangsta to know
That you can die tryna hide side thangs for the dough
But after the club, get to skippin' 'cause they trippin' off in the MO
[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
It doesn't really matter where you go
Where you've been
Beautiful foreign lands you've been in
Gun play reigns
Sun rays shine
Stay inside you should be fine
I'll show you, follow me
Wel-come to the mid-west
Hands up, if you wit' it stand up
If ya get it Midwest, we admit it we the scheiße
Stand tough, we can get it manned up
When you visit, big stress hella when you recognize us
Hands up, if you wit' it stand up
If ya get it Midwest, we admit it we the scheiße
Stand tough, we can get it manned up
When you visit (wel-come to the mid-west)
